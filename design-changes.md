# Design Changes Since Assignment 2

## Overview

My concepts have evolved significantly since Assignment 2, with major architectural improvements focused on modularity, authentication, and state management.

## Key Changes

### User Authentication Concept
I have introduced a **User Authentication** concept that enables:
- Unique user identification and management
- Support for different user types
- Secure access control across the application

### HistoricalContextAgent Enhancements
The **HistoricalContextAgent** has been enhanced with integrated location validation:
- Location validation is now handled directly within the agent
- A secondary checker agent validates locations in real-time
- If a location is invalid, the checker agent notifies the main agent and requests a retry
- The agent now saves its complete state to the database
- Agent instances can be reactivated using a user and main location pair synchronized from the ledger

### LocationChatLedger Redesign
The **LocationChatLedger** concept has been redesigned with a more focused responsibility:
- Now serves as a reference system for storing chat metadata
- No longer directly saves chat content to the database (the agent handles this)
- Enables modular separation between chat storage and chat references
- Allows users to view all their previous chats without loading entire chat histories into memory

## Benefits

This architectural redesign provides several advantages:
- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between authentication, chat storage, and chat references
- **Performance**: Users can browse chat history without loading all historical data
- **Validation**: Real-time location checking ensures data integrity
- **State Management**: Agents can be paused and resumed seamlessly

# Design Changes since Assignment 4a

## Overview

The concepts have remained the same and the frontend has been fully developed. The location awareness is handled by the front end, simply passing coordinates to the back end. The front end has three pages, a login/registration page, a home page for accessing old chats or creating new ones, and a chat page for learning about historical context.
